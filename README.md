Health Outcomes Prediction and Analysis Based on Air Quality Indicators

Project involves predicting future values and analyzing trends in air pollution levels and health impacts.
The analysis includes grouping data by geographical location, year, and indicator levels to identify the most polluted areas and assess the health risks associated with different levels of air pollution.

The project uses machine learning algorithms, specifically RandomForestRegressor and MultiOutputRegressor, for predicting health outcomes based on air quality indicators. The tech stack includes Python for coding, libraries such as Pandas and Scikit-learn for data manipulation
